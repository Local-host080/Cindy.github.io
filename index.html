      <p>
        Dear CINDY,
        <br><br>
        You are the <span class="highlight">sparkle</span> in my eyes, the <span class="highlight">flutter</span> in my heart, and the reason for my <span class="highlight">endless smiles</span>. From the moment our paths crossed, I knew there was something special about you. Your <span class="highlight">charming personality</span> and <span class="highlight">captivating smile</span> makes my world a better place.
        <br><br>
        I wanted to take this moment to let you know how much you mean to me. With every passing day, my feelings for you grow stronger. Your presence makes my heart skip a beat and fills my life with <span class="highlight">pure joy</span>. Every conversation we have leaves me wanting more, and I find myself daydreaming about the moments we could share together.
        <br><br>
        Please know that I treasure our connection and admire you deeply. You have a way of making me feel <span class="highlight">special</span> and <span class="highlight">cherished</span>. I am truly grateful to have you in my life, even if it's just as friends for now. But if you ever find it in your heart to explore something more, I would be the happiest person on Earth.
        <br><br>
        Yours sincerely,
        <br>
        PRABHAT
      </p>
